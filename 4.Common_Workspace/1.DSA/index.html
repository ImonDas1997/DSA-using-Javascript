    function OuterFunction() { 
var outerVariable = 100; 
function InnerFunction() {
 alert(outerVariable); 
} 
return InnerFunction; 
} 
var innerFunc = OuterFunction(); 
innerFunc(); // 100

//In the above example, return InnerFunction; returns InnerFunction from OuterFunction when you call OuterFunction(). A variable innerFunc reference the InnerFunction() only, not the OuterFunction(). So now, when you call innerFunc(), it can still access outerVariable which is declared in OuterFunction(). This is called Closure.

A closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.
A closure is a function having access to the parent scope. It preserves the data from the outside.

For every closure we have three scopes : 
● Local Scope (Own scope) 
● Outer Functions Scope
● Global Scope
