var outerVariable = 100; 
function InnerFunction() {
 alert(outerVariable); 
} 
return InnerFunction; 
} 
var innerFunc = OuterFunction(); 
innerFunc(); // 100

//In the above example, return InnerFunction; returns InnerFunction from OuterFunction when you call OuterFunction(). A variable innerFunc reference the InnerFunction() only, not the OuterFunction(). So now, when you call innerFunc(), it can still access outerVariable which is declared in OuterFunction(). This is called Closure.

A closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.
A closure is a function having access to the parent scope. It preserves the data from the outside.

For every closure we have three scopes : 
● Local Scope (Own scope) 
● Outer Functions Scope
● Global Scope 


<!-- You are given an arrayAwithNelements. You are allowed toremove only one element, which makes thesum of all the remaining elements exactly divisible by 7.

Your task is to find thefirst index of smallest elementthat can be removed from array. If there is no answer print-1. -->

function applyBasicMaths(N,A){
    let sum=0;
    for(let i=0;i<N;i++){
        sum=sum+A[i];
    }
    let min=Infinity;
    let index=-1;
    for(let i=0;i<N;i++){
        let diff=sum-A[i]
     if(diff%7===0 && A[i]<min)  {
         min=A[i];
         index=i;
     }     
        
    }
    console.log(index);

}
