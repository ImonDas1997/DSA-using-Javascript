// DSA 101 vs DSA 111
//  More Focus on Problem Solving
//  More Problem Statements
//  Focus on Patterns in Problem Solving
//  Various techniques and better approach

// Key - Value Pairs
//both are same  but in array we store only value and obj we store keynvalue pair...
let arr = [0, 1, 2, 3]; //here index are use to get values
let obj = { zero: 0, one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 }; //here key are use to get values
//keys are flexible we can change them but idex we can not change

console.log(arr[2]);

console.log(obj["two"]);
// we get same output

//data type of index and keys-->
//index are integer but keys  are strings

// coersion->data type changing in one to diffremt data type  is called coersion inn js.

let x = "5" - 5; //convertig string to a number//javascript try to not give an error and chnging data type and printing actual ans
console.log(x);
