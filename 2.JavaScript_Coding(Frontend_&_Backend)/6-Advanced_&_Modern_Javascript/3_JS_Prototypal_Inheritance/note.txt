The architecture of Js is also based upon inheritance.

Inheritance?
A human gets access to properties and methods (characteristics) of other human.
In Js, this applies to objects.



built in methods are available in array stored in  prototypes...it shores all values.every array has access to tyhis prototype.

Everything in Js is an Object.
best data structures is wo who can store Everything.inside the aobject we can store everything.
for exmple-->

// let insta_post = {

//     likes: 24,
//     url: 'https://ig.xyz',
//     comments: [{
//         user: 'shaik',
//         comment:'xyz'
//     }] ,
//     hashtags: ['cute', 'nature'],

// }

we call object got of javascript because it is the besy data sturucture.


We can use Js inheritance in two ways : 
1. Constructor Functions 
2. Object.create() method
